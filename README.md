ELK stack: elastic + logstash + kibana

Common trend: some rules have to be paid for, but then released for free after 30 or 60 days

## Test environment

### Network: OpenVpn network

- all traffic goes through the OpenVpn server

- clients are addressed by static IP addresses for convenience

- clients are students' home computers or VMs running in BME Cloud

- clients will run different operating systems

### Server, where IDS and monitoring software will be installed

- running Ubuntu 18.04

- OpenVpn set up with all traffic going through tun0 adapter

- VPS: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 200GB SSD
